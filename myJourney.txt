# Welcome to FG's Career Journey

Hello and welcome to my personal website! I am excited to share my professional journey with you and introduce you to the exciting new path I'm on.

**Background:**
In June 2023, my contract with UKSHA through Maxxima came to an end, marking the conclusion of a fulfilling chapter in my laboratory work history. With gratitude for the experiences and knowledge I gained during that time, I have decided to take a leap and embrace a new career path - coding.

**A Passion for Coding:**
Coding is not just a career change for me; it's a passionate pursuit I've longed for. The time is now right, and I am taking the first steps towards becoming what I've always aspired to be in the near future - a skilled coder and developer.

**My Journey:**
On this website, I intend to document my journey from a background in laboratory work to my transformation into a coder. You'll find my CV that reflects my past experiences, as well as links to my publications and work from my laboratory career.

**New Beginnings:**
As I embrace this exciting transition, I am eager to learn, grow, and contribute to the world of technology and coding. I invite you to join me on this journey of transformation and personal growth.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing this journey with you!

Sincerely,
Filomeno Giovetti
